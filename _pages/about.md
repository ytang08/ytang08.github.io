Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate in the School of Government & Public Policy at The University of Arizona. My research interests revolve around authoritarian politics, Chinese politics, the personalization of power within authoritarian regimes, and US-China relations. I am committed to learner-centered teaching, advocate for lifelong learning, and help my students grow and achieve their goals and dreams. I enjoy teaching and doing research. My work has been published by _**Comparative Political Studies**_, _**Journal of Chinese Political Science**_.

You can reach me at <ins>ytang08@arizona.edu</ins> with questions about my research.
