Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate in the School of Government & Public Policy at The University of Arizona. My research interests revolve around authoritarian politics, Chinese politics, personalization of power within authoritarian regimes, and US-China relations. My work has been published by _**Journal of Chinese Political Science**_.
