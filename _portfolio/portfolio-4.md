This page summarizes the student evaluations I received for my courses (*POL202*)(**Introduction to International Politics**) during the Fall 2024 semester.

The full evaluation report includes detailed visualizations of student feedback and the survey response rate.

Compared to the previous semester (Summer 2024), the student response rate more than **doubled** (increased from 15.2% to 38.6%).

Below are some of the comments that I got from the class I taught in Fall 2024 (POL202)

Comment one:

“The way the professor helped me out, he would respond in a very timely manner. He mentioned he would get back within a couple (of) days, but in reality, I sent him two emails, and he responded within a couple of minutes. I could not have gotten a better professor. “

Comment two:

“The course allowed students to engage in discussion after the readings in each unit to give their perspective on certain issues and ask further questions. Inquisitive modules were a great way to review the content of the course. The op-ed essays were rewarding challenges that encouraged students to write in a journalistic medium regarding topics on current events in international relations.”

Comment three:

“I liked the consistent weekly structure of this course and the individualized feedback.”


Comment four:

“I would like to say, I was not very knowledgeable in these topics, but I learned a lot. Mostly, from the corrections he made on mi(my) essays, and discussions. He is very easy to work with, and (I) wish there was (were) more professors like him.”

Comment five:
“Instructor was responsive and assisted students with assignment extensions and was understanding.”

Comment six:
“Professor Tang went out of his way to help the students.”
