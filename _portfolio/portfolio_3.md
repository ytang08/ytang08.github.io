title: "Letter of Evaluation (from peers)"
excerpt: "This is a peer evaluation letter for a class that I taught in Spring 2025, written by one of my colleagues from my IA697P course. A summary of the letter can be found below: “On April 15, 2025, Yongfeng Tang delivered a guest lecture for an undergraduate course in Comparative Politics on the topic of political parties and party systems. The lesson was designed to promote **active**, **student-centered learning** through the use of real-world examples, clear explanations of key concepts, and interactive polling tools such as Slido. Tang also facilitated a **collaborative group activity** that encouraged students to apply course material in a structured and time-sensitive manner. The session was *well-received*, with observational feedback noting Tang’s *clear communication*, *inclusive teaching practices*, and ability to make complex political science topics *accessible* and *engaging*. Recommendations for future iterations—including the use of collaborative digital platforms—will inform the continued development of Tang’s instructional approach.<br> A PDF version of the evaluation letter can be found below the picture. <br/><img src='/images/peer_evaluation_letter_s.png'><br/> <a href='/assets/pdf/Peer_feedback_letter.pdf' target='_blank'>Download PDF</a>"
