title: "Letter of Evaluation (from peers)"
excerpt: "This is a peer evaluation letter for a class that I taught in Spring 2025, written by one of my colleagues from my IA697P course.¬† A summary of the letter can be found below:
‚ÄúOn April 15, 2025, Yongfeng Tang delivered a guest lecture for an undergraduate course in Comparative Politics on the topic of political parties and party systems. The lesson was designed to promote **active**, **student-centered learning** through the use of real-world examples, clear explanations of key concepts, and interactive polling tools such as Slido. Tang also facilitated a **collaborative group activity** that encouraged students to apply course material in a structured and time-sensitive manner. The session was *well-received*, with observational feedback noting Tang‚Äôs *clear communication*, *inclusive teaching practices*, and ability to make complex political science topics *accessible* and *engaging*. Recommendations for future iterations‚Äîincluding the use of collaborative digital platforms‚Äîwill inform the continued development of Tang‚Äôs instructional approach.
