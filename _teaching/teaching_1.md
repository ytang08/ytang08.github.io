title: "Teaching Philosophy"
excerpt: "I believe that education should be accessible to all and that true learning extends beyond grades and test scores. My goal is to help students discover their personal *motivation* for learning, whether driven by career aspirations, intellectual curiosity, or civic engagement. In my teaching, I emphasize *critical thinking*, the application of theoretical concepts to *real-world cases*, and the cultivation of lifelong learning skills. I am committed to creating an **inclusive**, **supportive**, and **student-centered** environment that respects diverse learning needs and empowers students to find their voice, build confidence, and reach their full potential both inside and outside the classroom.
