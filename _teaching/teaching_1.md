I believe that education should be *accessible* to all and that true learning extends beyond grades and test scores. My goal is to help students discover their personal *motivation* for learning, whether driven by career aspirations, intellectual curiosity, or civic engagement. In my teaching, I emphasize *critical thinking*, the application of theoretical concepts to real-world cases, and the cultivation of lifelong learning skills. I am committed to creating an *inclusive*, *supportive*, and *student-centered* environment that respects diverse learning needs and empowers students to find their voice, build confidence, and reach their full potential both inside and outside the classroom.
