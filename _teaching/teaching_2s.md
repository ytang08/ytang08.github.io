My goal is to help students discover their personal **"why"** for studying comparative politics — a motivation that extends beyond grades, requirements, or course credits. Whether it is a drive to better understand global events, prepare for a career in public service or international relations, or simply to cultivate critical thinking skills for engaged citizenship, I aim to encourage students to view their education as an opportunity for personal and intellectual growth, not just a series of tasks to complete.

This philosophy is reflected in my sample syllabus, where I first ask students to articulate their individual learning goals at the start of the semester, such as developing skills in policy analysis, comparative case writing, or theoretical application. I then provide flexible options for major assignments, allowing students to choose between a policy memo, a country case study, or a theoretical essay depending on their interests and career aspirations. Additionally, during each class session, I incorporate active learning exercises that invite students to apply political theories to real-world examples, engage in debates about democratic backsliding, simulate decision-making in authoritarian regimes, and critically evaluate political data from global sources. Through these practices, I seek to create a classroom where education is **personalized**, **purposeful**, and **transformative**.


# POL/LAS 204 – Comparative Politics in the Age of Globalization

## Course Title and Number
**POL/LAS 204 – Comparative Politics in the Age of Globalization**

## Description of Course
This course will explore the field of comparative politics, which involves the analysis and comparison of the causes and consequences of different political systems across the world. The course will start by exploring how political scientists use the scientific method to understand political phenomena.

Next, we will introduce different theories that explain the emergence of modern states.

Then, we will apply these tools to explain the emergence of democracy and autocracy, the causes and consequences of different electoral systems, and finally, the economic and political effects of different institutional designs.

After completing the course, students will know the basics of different government institutions and have a basic understanding of the consequences of these different institutional forms. In doing so, we will explore several cases in depth from all regions of the world.

## Course Objectives
This course will introduce students to the field of comparative politics, which involves the study of governments outside the US. We will learn how to research and theorize about political systems across the world. In doing so, we will examine political institutions that are common to all forms of government and understand distinctions between different types of political systems.

We will also gain familiarity with the diversity of political organizations and institutions across the world, including democracies and dictatorships.

Finally, in analyzing these systems, we will learn how to use quantitative measures of political systems to examine both the causes and effects of different political institutions.

Throughout this course, students will be introduced to several commonly used datasets used by political scientists to measure democracy and autocracy and the strengths and weaknesses of those datasets.

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Identify the approaches and methodologies of comparative political scientists, using evidence to critically analyze questions and arguments about the emergence of democracy and autocracy.
- Describe the political systems in several countries, understanding both the roots of the emergence of those systems as well as the consequences of those systems.
- Demonstrate competency in working with numerical information by critically analyzing quantitative information, generating ideas that are supported by quantitative evidence, assessing the relevance of data and its associated implications in various contexts, and communicating those ideas in various formats (graphs, data tables, equations, oral presentations, or written reflections).
- Become familiar with the research questions, dependent variables, and independent variables used by political scientists in their research. Students will create their own research question and design a proper method to test that question quantitatively for their research paper.

## Course Format and Teaching Methods
The course will be in-person lecture-based (Monday and Wednesday each week). It will include several discussion posts (five in total) through D2L, as well as a semester-long research assignment simulating the processes political scientists use to produce research.

## Assignment Format

### 15% Discussion Posts
Each week will feature a quiz where the student will be asked to summarize the argument of one of the readings (five discussion posts in total, each counts as 3% of the final grade).

### 25% Mid-Term (closed exam)

### 25% Final Exam (closed exam)

### 35% Research Paper (see below)

### Research Paper Project:
#### 1. Paper Topic Assignment
Each student selects a research topic related to comparative politics. Suggested themes include:
- Democratic transitions and consolidation
- Political institutions (e.g., presidentialism vs. parliamentarism)
- Electoral systems and their effects
- Nationalism and populism
- Authoritarian regimes and their survival strategies
- Democratic Backsliding and its causes
- Or other topics approved by the instructor.

Submit a one-paragraph proposal, including:
- A research question.
- A brief hypothesis or argument.
- A justification for the topic's relevance.

This assignment is due on **Wednesday midnight (11:59 pm)** of the Third week of the semester. It counts as 10% of the Research Paper Project or 3.5% of the final grade.

#### 2. Annotated Bibliography Assignment
Compile an annotated bibliography with at least 5 scholarly sources. Each entry should include:
- A summary of the source.
- Its relevance to your research question.
- How it informs your analysis.

This assignment is due on **Wednesday midnight (11:59 pm)** of the Fifth week of the semester. It counts as 10% of the Research Paper Project or 3.5% of the final grade.

#### 3. Draft Paper Assignment
Each student brings a draft of their paper (minimum 5 pages) to class (in the second session of the Eighth Week of the semester). The draft paper is due before the second session of the Eighth week of this semester. It counts as 10% of the Research Paper Project and 3.5% of the final grade.

#### 4. Presentation and Peer-review Project
During the 9th week’s first session:  
Each student presents their argument in 3-5 minutes in front of the class.  
Peers provide feedback based on a rubric focusing on:
- Clarity of the research question and argument.
- Use of evidence.
- Strength of the comparative analysis.
- Writing and organization.

The presentation and peer-review feedback each count as 7.5% of the Research Paper Project and 2.625% of the final grade.

#### 5. Final Research Paper Project
Submit a 10–12 page paper that includes:
- **Introduction**: A clear research question and its significance.
- **Literature Review**: Discuss existing research relevant to the question.
- **Theoretical Framework**: Identify key variables and their expected relationship.
- **Evidence**: Include quantitative evidence to support your arguments/hypotheses.
- **Case Studies**: Include one or two Cases outside the US.
- **Analysis**: Evaluate findings in light of the theoretical framework.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and discuss their implications.
