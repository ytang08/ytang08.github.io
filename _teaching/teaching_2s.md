title: "Sample Syllabus"
excerpt: "This is a sample syllabus that I can potentially teach in the future at the undergraduate level. The course title is *< Comparative Politics in the Age of Globalization>*. This course offers a foundational exploration of democracy and autocracy—the two dominant regime types shaping global politics today. Students will examine **how political systems emerge**, **why some countries become democratic while others remain authoritarian**, and what factors contribute to their stability or decline. Through comparative analysis, the course introduces students to key concepts and methods used by political scientists to study regime types, institutions, political behavior, and governance. Special attention is given to understanding the causes and consequences of democratic transitions, authoritarian resilience, and hybrid regimes. Students will engage in *lectures*, *discussions*, and *in-class activities* that encourage critical thinking and comparative reasoning. A central feature of the course is a scaffolded, semester-long research project in which students select a country case (outside the U.S.) and investigate a major question related to democracy or autocracy. By the end of the course, students will have developed the tools to analyze political systems, assess evidence, and form well-supported arguments about the dynamics of regime change and persistence. <br> A PDF version can be found below the picture. <br/><img src='/images/introcp_s.png'> <br/>

<p><strong>"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."</strong></p>

My goal is to help students discover their personal **"why"** for studying comparative politics — a motivation that extends beyond grades, requirements, or course credits. Whether it is a drive to better understand global events, prepare for a career in public service or international relations, or simply to cultivate critical thinking skills for engaged citizenship, I aim to encourage students to view their education as an opportunity for personal and intellectual growth, not just a series of tasks to complete.

This philosophy is reflected in my sample syllabus, where I first ask students to articulate their individual learning goals at the start of the semester, such as developing skills in policy analysis, comparative case writing, or theoretical application. I then provide flexible options for major assignments, allowing students to choose between a policy memo, a country case study, or a theoretical essay depending on their interests and career aspirations. Additionally, during each class session, I incorporate active learning exercises that invite students to apply political theories to real-world examples, engage in debates about democratic backsliding, simulate decision-making in authoritarian regimes, and critically evaluate political data from global sources. Through these practices, I seek to create a classroom where education is **personalized**, **purposeful**, and **transformative**.

### **1.4 Teaching Philosophy**
In this course, my teaching philosophy continues to evolve with each student I meet. It is grounded in a commitment to support, challenge, and inspire you as you explore the complexities of political systems around the world. My goal is to help you build on your strengths, confront difficult questions with confidence, and discover your unique voice as a critical thinker and engaged global citizen.


### **1.5 Description of Course**
This course will explore the field of comparative politics, which involves the analysis and comparison of the causes and consequences of different political systems across the world. The course will start by exploring how political scientists use the scientific method to understand political phenomena.

Next, we will introduce different theories that explain the emergence of modern states.

Then, we will apply these tools to explain the emergence of democracy and autocracy, the causes and consequences of different electoral systems, and finally, the economic and political effects of different institutional designs.

After completing the course, students will know the basics of different government institutions and have a basic understanding of the consequences of these different institutional forms. In doing so, we will explore several cases in depth from all regions of the world.

## **Section 2: Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes**

### **2.1 Course Objectives[^1]**
This course will introduce students to the field of comparative politics, which involves the study of governments outside the US. We will learn how to research and theorize about political systems across the world. In doing so, we will examine political institutions that are common to all forms of government and understand distinctions between different types of political systems.

We will also gain familiarity with the diversity of political organizations and institutions across the world, including democracies and dictatorships.

Finally, in analyzing these systems, we will learn how to use quantitative measures of political systems to examine both the causes and effects of different political institutions.

Throughout this course, students will be introduced to several commonly used datasets used by political scientists to measure democracy and autocracy and the strengths and weaknesses of those datasets.

### **2.2 Expected Learning Outcomes**
At the end of the semester:
-Students will learn how comparative political scientists study politics by examining different approaches and methods. They will critically evaluate arguments about democracy and autocracy and understand the causes and consequences of these systems.
-Students will study the political systems of several countries, with a focus on one non-U.S. country for a research paper. They will develop expertise in that case by exploring its political history and outcomes.
-Students will also build skills in working with data—interpreting graphs, analyzing tables, and using quantitative evidence to support their arguments.
-Finally, students will learn how to ask strong research questions, identify independent and dependent variables, and engage in the peer review process to better understand how political science research is developed and evaluated.

## **Section 3: Course Formats and Logistics-related Issues**


### **3.1 Course Format and Teaching Methods**
The course will be in-person and lecture-based (delivered on Mondays and Wednesdays), but it will also emphasize *active student participation*. In addition to five discussion posts submitted through D2L, students will regularly engage in small group activities, case-based discussions, and interactive polling during class. A major component of the course is a semester-long research assignment designed to simulate the real-world research process of political scientists, encouraging you to ask critical questions, analyze evidence, and present your findings in both written and oral formats.

Rather than being completed all at once, the project is broken into manageable stages—each designed to build your skills step by step. From forming a research question and reviewing the literature to collecting evidence and presenting your findings, each component will help prepare you for the final paper. This structure not only supports your learning but also mirrors the process real political scientists go through when conducting research.

Each student selects a research topic related to comparative politics. Suggested themes include:
- Democratic transitions and consolidation
- Political institutions (e.g., presidentialism vs. parliamentarism)
- Electoral systems and their effects
- Nationalism and populism
- Authoritarian regimes and their survival strategies
- Democratic Backsliding and its causes
- Or other topics approved by the instructor.
