title: "Sample Lesson Plan"
excerpt: "This is a sample lesson plan that I had taught in Spring 2025. This sample lesson plan, designed for a guest lecture in a comparative politics course, explores the role of political parties and party systems through a combination of lecture, real-world examples, interactive quizzes, and a collaborative group activity. The session emphasizes **student engagement**, **active learning**, and **the application of theory to practice**. By integrating technology and encouraging peer discussion, the lesson reflects my commitment to *student-centered*, *evidence-based teaching*, and *continuous improvement in instructional delivery*. A PDF version of the lesson plan can be found below the picture. <br/><img src='/images/sample_lesson_plan_s.png'><br/>
